In a two-dimensional XY coordinate system, there are two groups of agents: Defenders and Intruders, each consisting of 10 agents. The positions of the Defenders are represented by a (10, 2) matrix, and the positions of the Intruders are represented as another (10, 2) matrix. The objective is to pair each Defender with an Intruder such that the total Euclidean distance between the pairs is minimized.
