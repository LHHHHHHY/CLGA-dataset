In a two-dimensional XY coordinate system, there are 10 Defenders and 10 Intruders, each represented by a (10, 2) matrix of coordinates. The Defenders are located at [[1.203727, 2.969430], [1.727916, -6.355782], [3.139244, 0.343098], [-4.423817, -2.926338], [-6.931869, -5.268187], [1.603833, -0.255801], [-0.419330, -1.707259], [1.087489, -3.886456], [-1.301701, 0.365086], [4.945316, 0.945933]], and the Intruders are at [[-28.121649, 32.066541], [-7.337243, 41.994851], [-2.856919, -46.448113], [-38.720570, -29.654847], [-45.722895, 3.935132], [-10.851915, 45.113331], [34.614540, -26.756196], [19.535534, 42.926890], [-33.087210, -29.893860], [-28.318632, 40.274682]]. The task is to match each Defender to an Intruder to minimize the sum of the Euclidean distances between all pairs.
